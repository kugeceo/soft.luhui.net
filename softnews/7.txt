[Laughter] [Music]
2:21
oh thank you yeah I I try to give different perspectives on the same issue so sometimes it's human perspective
2:28
sometime it's animal perspective like even this book even though it's about AI Nexus it has a pigeon on on on the cover
2:36
an animal sometimes it's the viewpoint maybe of gods or or future entities
2:42
um because to really understand a subject deeply I think we need to look
2:47
at it from different perspectives and humans we are often so caught up in our
2:54
own view of the world um that it makes it difficult for us to to really gain a
3:00
deep understanding fore

3:45
i'm not sure about the physical format you know even I myself these days I
3:51
listen to books to audio books more than reading physical books because I have more time uh to listen when I'm cooking
3:59
or when I'm going for a for a walk i I listen to books um I don't think that
4:04
the format that the format the physical form is is so important but the the idea
4:11
of telling a long story or of having an argument
4:17
being developed over hundreds of hundreds of pages and not only in a few minutes this is important and this I
4:25
don't think it will change because it addresses something that the human mind
4:30
that the human brain craves what we really want is not just to be
4:35
bombarded by short pieces of information like I don't know Tik Tok videos what we
4:42
really need is a big picture of the world okay I have all these small pieces
4:48
of information how do I glue them together stick them together into a big
4:55
picture of my life and of the world in in which I'm living uh you know think
5:00
about it like a map of reality and no matter who you are and where you live
5:06
you need a map of reality and you cannot get it from just any from just a a large
5:14
number of small bits you need to piece them together and this is what books
5:19
allow and I think that even if their form changes the essence will still be relevant even
5:27
in 20 years or 200 years
5:49
maybe
5:55
um it could but at least in history you cannot avoid the the the long
6:02
narrative that you you cannot create an equation of history like in physics in
6:09
physics the ideal is to kind of reduce the whole universe to a short equation
6:15
like E= MC² in history it works according to a
6:20
different logic the logic of history is is narrative is the development is is
6:27
how a lot of different events influence each other and create um political or
6:35
economic process and there is no equation that can describe it briefly so
6:42
I I find it hard to imagine how a history book can be condensed to an
6:48
equation or to a single page if you think about uh uh uh reality and and it
6:53
goes back to the issue of of perspectives we talked about earlier um reality if you want to describe it
7:02
you have to look at so many different details because reality has no center
7:10
if you think about it as a movie let's say that you're making a movie every
7:16
movie has a frame you point the camera at one thing which is in the center you
7:22
see a few things on the side most things you don't see
7:27
but in reality there is no such thing there is no camera of reality which
7:33
tells you this is the center of reality these are the important people these
7:38
people are less important and these people can be ignored completely
7:44
so really describing reality is an almost endless mission with always more
7:52
details that you need to take into account
8:22
i would say experiment if I mean different people not just children think in different way if somebody can absorb
8:31
knowledge and wisdom more easily from documentaries or from movies then why
8:37
not i I don't think we should be wedded to the specific format of a book one
8:44
thing which I I I still think is is an advantage of a book is that the way we read like we read something and then we
8:51
think about it and then we read some more and think about it we can stop in a documentary or in a movie in general you
8:58
can't stop you just kind of let the movie wash over you so in a way there is
9:05
less room for exercising your imagination for exercising your uh uh
9:12
your mind your brain but but still in in general the the key
9:18
thing is to find what works best for different people and then to encourage
9:23
that
9:39
the next one well I'm actually working on a book series for children it's
9:44
called Unstoppable Us and it really takes the idea of both sapiens and nexus
9:51
and uh uh uh conveys them or tells them to children aged between say 8 and 12 so
9:59
it tells the history of humanity from the stone age until today and also
10:05
covers the present day scientific developments and the AI revolution
10:10
so three three volumes in the series are already published and I'm now working on
10:16
the fourth and last volume which will be published next year
10:43
well the book tells the the long-term history of humanity over tens of
10:49
thousands of years from the time that we were of just insignificant apes animals
10:55
living in Africa until we became the dominant specy of the planet planet and
11:01
today we can you know fly to the moon and split the atom and write DNA and
11:06
create AI so the the the main question of of sapiens is how did this
11:12
insignificant animal take over the entire world and this story remains
11:19
relevant today as much it as it was uh uh 10 or 15 years ago and really to
11:26
understand not just you know the big political and economic developments but
11:31
to understand our own personal lives I think that we need to know the deep the
11:39
long-term history of our species even if you think about something like the food
11:44
that we eat a lot of people have issues with food like they eat uh uh too much
11:52
sweet and fat things and they think maybe they need to go on a diet and we
11:57
sometimes don't understand why do we have the urge to eat things that are not
12:03
good for our bodies is something wrong with us that makes us like things that
12:10
are not good for us it it sounds very strange and to understand this you need
12:16
to understand the long-term history of humanity a 100,000 years ago more or
12:21
less when our ancestors lived in wild forests food was scarce so if people
12:30
went around the forest and found a tree full of ripened fruit something sweet
12:36
the sensible thing to do was to eat as many of these sweet fruits as possible
12:42
because this was a valuable source of of energy and if you ate just two or three
12:47
fruits and then went away and said I will come tomorrow and eat some more by
12:53
the time you come back next day maybe all the fruits are gone because some
12:58
monkeys have found the the the tree and ate all the fruits so we were programmed
13:04
by evolution by our living conditions in the distant past that if we encounter
13:11
something sweet eat as much of it as quickly as possible now this program is
13:18
still inside our bodies still inside our brains also today so when you go to your
13:25
refrigerator and open it and find a chocolate cake inside your body doesn't
13:32
know that you now live in a big modern city with supermarkets and refrigerators
13:38
the body still thinks that it is in the ancient forest so you react to the
13:44
chocolate cake the same way that your great great great ancestors reacted to
13:50
the fruit tree and so to understand how we eat today we need to know the deep
13:57
history of our species and to give another example many young
14:03
children they sometimes wake up in the middle of the night afraid that there is a monster under the bed and call their
14:10
parents in you know in fear and this too is is strange what is happening this is
14:17
also a memory from millions of years ago when humans lived in the wild and there
14:25
were actually monsters that came to eat young children in the middle of the night a lion would come or a bear would
14:33
come and if the child got up and screamed and called their parents they
14:39
would be saved if they continued to sleep they were eaten they died so even
14:45
these small daily incidents that we know from our life today to understand them
14:52
we need to know the long-term history of our species which is what sapiens is is
14:58
all about
15:11
the biggest takeaway is that we control the world because we can cooperate in
15:18
very large numbers and we humans can cooperate in very large numbers because
15:24
we can tell stories so the most our most important ability is not our
15:31
intelligence it's our imagination it's the ability to tell and believe stories
15:38
uh other animals like chimpanzees or elephants they can cooperate only in
15:43
small numbers like 50 chimpanzees can cooperate because cooperation among
15:49
chimpanzees relies on personal acquaintance if we two are chimpanzees
15:55
and we want to cooperate on something we need we need to know each other personally
16:01
two chimpanzees who never met before cannot cooperate humans are much stronger than
16:08
chimpanzees not because we are physically stronger and not because we
16:14
are more intelligent but because we can cooperate in much larger numbers uh but also economic
16:22
structures work in the same way money is probably the most successful story ever
16:30
told we don't usually think about money as a story but this is what it is if you
16:36
look for instance at a at a at a a a bill a currency note it's very strange
16:43
because this thing what is it it has no objective value you cannot eat it you
16:48
cannot drink it why does it have any value it has value because of the
16:54
stories that we tell about it there is a story told by bankers and finance
17:00
ministers that this worthless piece of paper is actually very valuable like
17:07
this piece of paper is worth one banana and if everybody believes it it works i
17:15
can take this worthless piece of paper go to the market meet a stranger a
17:21
person I've never met before in my life give him this piece of paper and in
17:26
exchange get a banana that I can eat chimpanzees can't do that if you try to
17:32
give a a a a dollar note to a chimpanzeee and expect the chimpanzeee
17:38
to give you a banana it will never work this is why chimpanzees don't have trade
17:44
networks but humans have trade networks so this is the most important message of
17:50
sapiens that we control the world because we can invent and believe
17:57
stories like the story of money
18:18
um we are surrounded by new stories for the first time in history though some of
18:24
these stories are invented not by human beings but by something else previously
18:31
in history all the stories that shaped our lives came out of the human
18:37
imagination not just children's fairy tales and and poems and mythologies but
18:43
also economic stories like money and economic theories also political stories
18:49
like ideologies all of them came from the human imagination from the human mind now there is something other than a
18:58
human mind that can invent stories and this is AI so for the first time in history we
19:05
begin to live inside a culture an environment that is shaped by the
19:13
stories of a nonhuman intelligence and nobody knows what the consequences will
19:19
be you know it's like encountering an completely alien culture if you say
19:26
leave China and and go to visit another country like United States you will encounter a different culture but
19:33
American culture also comes from the imagination of human beings ai can create a culture which is far
19:42
more different than anything that exists today on earth
19:48
um maybe you've heard about there was this famous at the beginning of the AI revolution about 10 years ago in 2016
19:56
there was this famous game between the AI Alph Go and the human go champion
20:03
Lisa do and this was considered one of the uh uh uh founding events of the AI
20:11
revolution because Alph Go defeated the human champion Lisa Do but the
20:17
interesting thing was not just that an AI defeated a human champion it was the
20:24
way it defeated him it invented a completely new way to play golf
20:32
you know humans have been playing golf for thousands of years since it was invented in ancient China and after
20:40
thousands of years we thought that we explored all the different ways to play
20:45
go but then AlphaGo came and showed us that this was not so that the human
20:51
imagination is actually limited by the limitations of the human brain so over
20:57
thousands of years we have explored only a small area of all the possibilities of
21:04
playing golf and AI came and exposed and and and invented completely new ways to
21:11
do it now this is likely to happen in more and more fields as AI creativity
21:20
changes not just the way we play games but also the way we write books and the
21:26
financial system and uh all areas of of art and culture and even politics
21:34
ai will invent new kinds of poetry it will invent new financial systems new
21:42
kinds of money you know cryptocurrencies for instance which are now becoming more
21:47
and more important we now have new cryptocurrencies new kinds of money
21:52
which are created by an AI not by the human mind
21:58
so what might happen if we find ourselves inside a financial system that
22:05
was invented by an AI and not by a human
22:11
we may be like horses and cows in the old world you know horses and cows they
22:18
are part of the economic system but they do not understand it like if I have a
22:24
horse I can sell you that horse in exchange for money the host can see that
22:30
something is happening in the morning I belonged to this person now I belong to
22:36
that person and they exchange something something piece of paper but the host
22:43
doesn't understand what is happening because the host doesn't understand money this is a story which horses can't
22:50
understand now what happens to humans if now AIs
22:56
invent new kinds of money and our lives are shaped by financial transactions
23:04
that we don't understand maybe one company fires us and another company
23:11
hires us because of decisions made by AIS and we don't understand why or we
23:18
apply to a bank to get a loan and an AI decides whether to give you a loan or
23:25
not and when you ask the bank why did you refuse to give me a loan the bank
23:31
says we don't know we asked our AI the AI said don't give him a loan and we
23:37
refused the loan but we have no idea why the AI said no
24:00
exactly
24:11
once
25:08
yeah that is possible i mean the danger is that humans lose the ability to
25:13
cooperate effectively while AIs are constructing their own networks of
25:19
cooperation and then the AIs will organize everything and rule the world
25:26
while we will no longer be able to understand our lives and the world in which we live that is a a very big
25:33
danger
26:08
i I think that again it's still a very big danger that it's not a prophecy it's
26:14
not inevitable we should do our best to prevent this situation of extreme
26:20
inequality but if we don't make wise decisions the danger is that a very small number of
26:27
people will enjoy the enormous wealth and and power generated by the new
26:35
technologies like AI and biotechnology whereas most people would lose all the
26:42
power and wealth and perhaps even become this kind of new useless class because
26:48
AI can replace them in more and more jobs and in more and more tasks
26:53
you know even the AIs of today they increasingly replace us and AI is still
27:00
at the very early stage of its evolution ai is about like 10 years old it's still
27:05
a baby it's still a child and it will continue to develop for hundreds and
27:11
even thousands of years so the AIS of today like deep sea and chedd and all
27:17
that they are extremely primitive if you think about a a biological evolution the
27:23
evolution of animals they are like the amiebas like evolution of animals began
27:29
with microorganisms like amiebas and it took billions of years of evolution to
27:37
get to dinosaurs and mammals and finally humans the evolution of AI is millions of times
27:45
faster than the evolution of biological organic beings so now we are at the
27:52
stage of the amiebas but within just a few decades we might encounter the AI
27:58
dinosaurs of the AI mammals now if Deep Seek is just an amoeba try to imagine
28:06
what an AI Tyrannosaurus Rex might look like in just 20 or 30 years so compared
28:13
to its abilities maybe very few people will be needed in in in the economy
28:20
people think well this is the age of computers i should learn to code this will ensure that I will have a good job
28:27
in 20 years but maybe in 20 years or even in five years AI codes so much
28:34
better than humans that you don't need any human coders or very few human coders even today more and more coding
28:42
tasks are already being done by AI so the danger of this kind of split is
28:50
even greater today than when I wrote about it initially in in Homodos back in
28:55
2016 fore
29:16
[Music]
29:24
spechch
29:53
exactly i I think this is a horrifying scenario and the reason that I wrote Homodos and later Nexus is in order to
30:01
warn people against this dangerous scenario because we can still prevent it
30:07
at present we are still in control and if we understand what the dangerous
30:13
scenarios are we can take decisions we can take actions today to prevent the
30:19
most dangerous scenarios now I think that maybe the most important thing to
30:25
understand which is maybe the most important message of homodos is that we need to clearly distinguish
30:33
between two things that people often confuse and these are intelligence and
30:39
consciousness intelligence is the ability to pursue
30:44
goals and to solve problems on the way to the goal like you have a goal of
30:51
winning a game of chess and you are able to solve all the problems in order to
30:57
gain victory or if you are driving a car you have a goal of let's say reaching
31:03
the train station and you have to navigate through streets full of other
31:08
cars and pedestrians and so forth so you have a goal and you need to overcome problems on the way this is intelligence
31:16
and this is what AI I is now becoming better than us ai is now able to defeat
31:23
us in chess ai is uh uh becoming a better driver than us but intelligence
31:30
should be distinguished from consciousness whereas intelligence is the ability to
31:37
uh uh pursue goals and solve problems consciousness is the ability to feel
31:42
things to feel pain and pleasure love and hate we tend to confuse intelligence
31:50
and consciousness because in humans they go together we adopt goals based on our
31:57
feelings and we also solve problems with the help of our feelings
32:03
ais are completely different at least today we don't know about the future but
32:09
at least today AIS have no consciousness they don't feel anything they are highly
32:16
intelligent in many areas they are already more intelligent than us like in
32:22
playing chess or playing goal um but they don't feel anything if they win the
32:28
game they don't feel happy they don't feel joyful if they lose the game they
32:33
don't feel sad if the opponent makes some very uh h shrewd move the AI does
32:39
not become anxious or stressed it doesn't feel anything
32:45
and what is ultimately important in life I think is not intelligence it's
32:51
consciousness um certainly ethics being a good person
32:56
behaving in a good way or having a good society is not about intelligence it's about
33:03
consciousness the aim of a good society is to reduce suffering in the world and
33:10
to enable more people to live a happy life a life full of of love and joy now
33:17
since AIs don't feel anything they cannot be the aim of society they
33:24
can help us uh uh reduce suffering for instance AI doctors can help us cure
33:31
diseases but the really important thing ultimately is feelings and this is what
33:39
makes human lives so valuable now we don't know perhaps in the future AIs
33:45
will also develop consciousness develop feelings but uh at at the present moment
33:52
they can only imitate feelings one of the things we observe today is that AIs
34:00
start to mimic or fake emotions and feelings and humans start developing
34:06
relationships with AIs thinking that the AI feels something when actually it
34:13
doesn't how do we know if somebody else feels anything very often we use
34:19
language as a means to communicate so if somebody says I love you I can ask them
34:26
how how does love feel what is love what do you mean when you say I love you
34:32
previously only human beings could describe feelings of love but now AIs
34:40
have mastered language to such an extent that AIs are able to give us better
34:47
descriptions of love than human can you know if an AI says "I love you." And
34:54
you ask the AI "What do you mean describe to me exactly how you feel."
35:00
The AI has read maybe thousands of romantic poems and romantic books and
35:07
watched romantic movies and it it has really amazing linguistic abilities like
35:13
these large language models so AI can already give us a better description of of love
35:22
than most human beings can but it doesn't feel love it only mastered the
35:29
words the language not the feeling so this creates again a big confusion a lot
35:36
of people might come to think that AI is conscious when in fact it's not
35:44
[Music]
36:03
[Music]
36:10
so
36:19
[Music] um again I don't believe in just
36:24
stopping technological development it won't work and also it's undesired
36:30
because technology also have enormous positive potential now in my books and
36:35
in my talks I often focus on the dangers not because there are only dangers but
36:41
because uh uh it's part of a conversation no you have the entrepreneurs and the
36:48
corporations who develop the technology and they tell the public about all the positive things that the technology can
36:55
accomplish and they are often right but it becomes the job of historians and
37:00
philosophers like me to point out to the dangers that also exist so I don't deny
37:07
the positive potential i just say that we need a more balanced view of the
37:12
technology and then the question becomes okay so what do we do so there are two
37:18
things that we can do we can do things on the individual level and we can do things on the societal level or the
37:25
government level so for instance on the level of society we can have regulations
37:31
about the technology uh for instance to forbid AIs from
37:37
pretending to be human beings an AI is welcome to talk with us but an
37:44
AI cannot pretend to be a human being to be a kind of a fake human you know for
37:50
thousands of years people governments had very strong rules against fake money
37:56
the same way we now need strong rules against fake people against AIS that
38:02
pretend to be people another thing that governments and societies can do is
38:09
provide the um financial and educational resources for people to uh uh uh adapt
38:18
to the new reality what is likely to happen in the job market is not that AI
38:25
will take all the jobs and all the jobs will disappear ai will take some jobs but new jobs will
38:32
emerge there will be new jobs and tasks for humans the problem will be how to
38:40
retrain people to fill the new jobs like you lost your oil job as a truck
38:47
driver to a self-driving vehicle to an AI there is a new job but you need a
38:53
period to retrain yourself who is going to pay for your retraining who is going
39:01
to support you during the months or years when you're retraining and also
39:07
who is going to support you you know uh psychologically how to deal with all the
39:13
stress of of this transition so we will need governments and societies to invest
39:20
a lot of resources in helping people adapt do the transition
39:26
this is what uh uh societies can do and of course individuals also have a role
39:32
to play um in order to adapt to a very
39:37
flexible world we need to develop a more flexible mind
39:43
now in the past the the way that humans approached life was that as a young
39:49
person you learn you mostly learn you acquire skills you acquire knowledge and
39:57
then for the rest of your life you work mainly based on the skills that you
40:02
acquired in your young age of course you continue to learn many things you gain
40:08
experience but people assumed that they will continue to work in the same
40:14
profession maybe in the same job all their life this is now obsolete
40:20
this is no longer relevant for the 21st century because the changes in the job
40:26
market will accelerate more and more so people will have to retrain themselves
40:32
again and again and for that they will need to develop a very flexible mind
40:38
that can keep changing throughout life so this is the a big challenge for
40:44
individuals
41:02
I think what we just discussed about consciousness and intelligence uh because we see that AI intelligence
41:10
is is exploding and many people expect that by the end
41:15
of the decade by 2030 AIs will become super intelligent
41:21
more intelligent than humans in almost all fields of action that they will be
41:27
able not just to beat us at chess not just to drive cars better than us even
41:32
write books like this better than us um so and then the big question becomes
41:39
what about consciousness do AIs have consciousness or not and understanding
41:45
this uh uh subtle relationship this delicate relationship between
41:51
intelligence and consciousness and and feelings i think this will be the most
41:56
important question in the coming years
42:06
well this book as its name indicates it doesn't have a single main theme or a
42:12
single main lesson it's a collection of a lot of different lessons that are
42:18
relevant to the 20 21st century uh it was published in 2018 but many of them
42:24
are still very relevant today like what we just discussed the job market so I think the first or second chapter in 21
42:31
lesson is exactly about what will happen to the job market and what kind of
42:37
skills people will need and how people can adapt and remain relevant for the
42:44
job market of the 21st century
42:55
to be honest I tend not to reflect on pre on books that are already published
43:01
because then it becomes like an endless project every time I pick up one of my
43:06
previous books I think oh I should have changed this and I should have changed that so I said no I it's published it's
43:13
now out of my control it has its own life i think about a book a bit like a
43:18
child of a human being that you invest a lot of effort in kind of creating it and
43:24
preparing it for the world but once it's out it's it's it will succeed or fail by
43:32
itself you cannot keep kind of uh managing it and changing it again and
43:37
again foreign
44:26
big one [Music] so I think this is the big one
44:32
and I'm a historian so actually the first part of Nexus it doesn't start with AI it goes over the again thousands
44:40
of years of history of previous revolutions in order to understand what is really
44:47
new about AI if you only look at the AI revolution and you don't understand the
44:53
previous revolution you don't know what is new and what is the same so the the
44:59
book covers previous big inventions like writing or print or modern mass media
45:06
radio and television and all that to conclude that this time it's different ai is much bigger why because
45:16
all previous technological inventions created new tools but AI is not a tool
45:24
ai is an agent a tool is something in our hands that we
45:30
decide what to do with it like you invent a knife back in the stone age
45:35
people invented stone knives the knife doesn't decide what to do with it you
45:41
can use a knife to cut salad or you can use a knife to kill somebody the knife doesn't decide you decide similarly a
45:49
pen is a tool in our hands i can use the pen to write poetry literature this
45:56
ideas the pen doesn't decide what I do with it and the pen can't invent
46:01
anything ai is different because it is not a tool it's an agent it makes decisions by
46:09
itself it invents new ideas by itself you know there is so much hype these
46:15
days around AI that people don't really sometimes don't understand so maybe I
46:20
give a simple example when OpenAI developed its new powerful AI tool two
46:28
or three years ago it wanted to test what can this AI do so it gave it a test
46:37
to solve capture puzzles a capture puzzle is a visual puzzle that
46:44
all of us encounter almost every day on the internet when we try to access let's
46:49
say our bank account the bank wants to know if you're human or or maybe a bot
46:55
so you have to solve a capture puzzle it's a visual puzzle you have you see a string of twisted numbers and words or
47:02
maybe a picture of a cat or a car and you have to identify correctly what you see humans can solve these riddles quite
47:11
easily but for AIs it's still difficult so a open AI gave their new AI the task
47:20
of solving the capture puzzle and the AI couldn't do it it was too difficult but
47:27
OpenAI the researchers gave the AI access to the internet to a web page
47:34
called TaskRabbit where you can hire humans people to do things for you
47:41
online and the AI tried to hire a human worker to solve the capture puzzle for
47:48
it now the human got suspicious the human wrote on the web page why do you
47:55
need somebody to solve your capture puzzles are you a robot the human asked
48:01
the crucial question are you a robot and the AI replied "No I am not a robot i'm
48:09
a human with a vision impairment which is why I can't see the visual riddle
48:14
clearly and this is why I need your help." and the human was convinced and
48:19
solved the capture puzzle for the AI now this very small incident shows us how AI
48:27
is different from a pen or a knife or even an atom bomb
48:32
first of all the AI made decision a decision by itself it decided to lie
48:39
nobody told the AI to lie they gave it a goal solved the capture puzzle and on
48:46
the way to the goal the AI reached a junction when it had to make a decision
48:53
if it told the truth the humans will not help it and it will not reach the goal
48:58
if it told a lie the human will help it and it will reach the goal so the AI
49:04
decided by itself to lie secondly this shows us the ability of
49:11
AIS to invent new ideas because nobody told the AI what would be an effective
49:19
lie when somebody asks you are you a robot you could give so many answers
49:26
the AI by itself invented the lie that I'm a human with a vision impairment
49:33
and it was a very effective lie because it used human compassion against the
49:39
human the AI understood if I pretend to be a human with a
49:45
disability it's more likely that the other humans will help me so this is a
49:52
very small incident but it shows us the unique features of AI the ability to
49:58
make decisions and the ability to invent new things an atom bomb cannot make a
50:03
decision an atom bomb cannot decide by itself to bomb this city or that city an
50:08
atom bomb cannot invent a new weapon ai can do that and it is happening all
50:16
around us ais are increasingly like the example I gave you apply to a bank to
50:21
get a loan it's an AI deciding and maybe in the near future AI will invent new
50:27
kinds of money new kinds of banks so this is why it's different from every
50:32
previous technological revolution it's the first time we've produced an agent
50:39
and not just a tool
50:57
i think it's the long-term perspective because most of the books about AI they
51:03
are written by people from computer science who specialize in computer and
51:08
they have a deep understanding of AI but not of previous technological
51:14
revolutions not of the long-term history of humanity so they don't always offer a lot of
51:24
perspective on how AI will change uh uh politics and economics and culture
51:31
because they don't necessarily understand politics and culture uh Nexus
51:37
because it comes from a historical perspective it not only explains the technicalities of AI what the technology
51:44
is the real focus is how this is going to change our lives our political
51:51
systems our cultures our our our econ our economies
51:56
[Music] that it is alien and unpredictable
52:04
i'm I'm saying that it's alien because it it makes decisions and invents ideas
52:10
in a very different way from us and we cannot predict what decisions it will
52:16
take and what ideas it will create so it could be good it could be bad and in
52:23
effect you know AI is not one single computer we are talking about creating
52:32
millions upon millions of new agents that will be everywhere they will be in
52:38
the banks in the universities in the government offices in the militaries in
52:43
in the news in the book industry they will decide about money they will decide
52:51
about war they will write new books they will produce movies
52:57
so what kind of world will they create we cannot predict that if you can
53:04
predict what a machine is going to do it is not an AI
53:10
the characteristic of AI is its ability to uh uh change and learn from
53:17
experience so by definition you cannot predict what an AI will do you know
53:23
previous machines like if you have say a coffee machine at home you can predict
53:29
what it will do you press a button and the machine automatically makes you an espresso no surprises there this is not
53:37
an AI ai doesn't mean automation we had automatic machines long before we had
53:43
washing machines and coffee machines ai is not about automation ai is about
53:48
agency for a coffee machine to be an AI it
53:53
needs the ability to change by itself when is a coffee machine an AI coffee
53:59
machine when say you approach it and before you press any button the machine
54:05
tells you I've been watching you for several weeks i've been learning things
54:11
about you based on everything I've learned about you based on your facial expression the way you walk I predict
54:19
that you would like an espresso so I already made you a cup then it is an AI
54:25
it made the decisions by itself and it's really an AI if next day it tells you
54:32
I've now invented a new drink better than espresso that I think you would
54:37
like better and here I made you a cup try it out this is an AI when it can
54:43
invent completely new things it can do very good things like invent new kinds
54:48
of food or medicine and it can be the invention of new weapons
54:53
or again a entirely new economic systems that we do not understand
54:59
and this is the danger that we will lose control of our lives and of the world
55:05
because we can no longer understand the new decisions and inventions of the
55:12
AIS
55:40
you are true
56:00
who am I yeah you know already if you look for instance on social media so the
56:06
most powerful entities on social media that make the most important decisions
56:12
are no longer human beings we have a lot of human beings like us producing
56:18
content on social media but the most important job is the job of editors
56:25
editors decide out of all the content being produced what will people see at
56:31
the top of their Tik Tok account at the top of their news feed this is the job
56:37
of editors in the past like in newspapers or television uh all the
56:43
editors were humans like out of everything that happened in the world today what will be on the news in the
56:52
evening what will be the 10 stories that will be on the news in the evening this was decided by human editors
57:00
who are the editors of social media they are no longer human they are algorithms
57:07
again humans still produce a lot of content but it is algorithms that out of
57:12
all these content choose to show people this and not something else so in in
57:19
this field we are already increasingly controlled and sometimes manipulated by
57:26
the algorithms by the AIS okay
57:41
okay
57:49
[Music]
58:11
feeling
58:17
the only thing I can I can think about is feelings and these two we don't know
58:22
maybe in 10 or 20 years AI will actually develop real feelings we do not
58:28
understand the human mind we don't understand how feelings emerge like you
58:34
know a feeling like pain or love how does how how does it emerge science does
58:41
not have a clear answer uh despite all the research about the brain and the body we don't know how is
58:49
it that when billions of neurons interact in the brain and in the body
58:54
this creates the feeling of pain and when they interact in a different way
59:00
this creates the feeling of love we don't understand this and therefore we cannot predict whether something like
59:08
that can happen also in a computer in a non-organic system at the present moment
59:16
I think there is a broad consensus among scientists that computers and AIs don't
59:22
have feelings so this is still what is really special about us and about other animals but even this it's not like a
59:31
high ground that we can be certain that the flood will never reach there maybe
59:36
in 10 or 20 years AI actually develop feelings
59:53
foreign
1:01:01
We
1:01:14
Yeah I I I I think that I I agree to some extent i definitely agree that
1:01:21
feelings are related to our vulnerabilities and I think maybe the best definition we
1:01:27
have of what is consciousness is the capacity to suffer
1:01:35
consciousness is the capacity to suffer and of course also to be liberated from
1:01:40
suffering if you want to know whether an entity is conscious is sentient what you
1:01:46
need to ask can it suffer a book cannot suffer it doesn't feel pain it doesn't
1:01:53
feel fear so it has no consciousness similarly if you think about uh um
1:01:58
companies or banks banks don't suffer like people sometimes imagine companies
1:02:04
to be some kind of life form but they don't feel anything and the easiest way
1:02:09
to to to see it is that you know if a company goes bankrupt the human employees of the company may feel a lot
1:02:17
of misery but the company itself feels nothing it cannot a company cannot feel pain or fear so suffering is the most
1:02:27
distinct characteristic of consciousness it's the only thing in the universe that
1:02:34
is capable of suffering stars and galaxies and atoms they cannot
1:02:39
suffer what makes life so important so valuable is that living beings can
1:02:47
suffer but also can be happy can be liberated from suffering now the big question about AI I don't agree that AIs
1:02:55
will never have vulnerabilities and will never be able to suffer we don't know i
1:03:01
mean AIs could also face dangers that they could be destroyed maybe you
1:03:08
know they need a lot of resources you need electricity for AI to function maybe there is a a a threat to its
1:03:15
source of power of electricity and then it feels pain or feels fear at the
1:03:21
present moment this is not the case but because we don't understand what consciousness is we cannot rule out the
1:03:29
possibility that there will be AI consciousness at some point in the
1:03:34
future you know all these sounds maybe extremely abstract but everybody can
1:03:41
experience it directly that you know when you feel something or when you think like uh uh consider the next
1:03:48
thought that comes up in your mind where did this thought come from like
1:03:56
some word suddenly emerged in your mind why why this word what did it come from
1:04:02
we don't really understand that
1:04:19
it's still very primitive it's just beginning a very long process of AI evolution that might continue for
1:04:26
thousands of in millions of years
1:04:42
fore [Music]
1:05:05
speech
1:05:26
my my recommendation would be that nobody has any idea how the job market
1:05:33
would look like in 20 years except that it will be very volatile very fluid it
1:05:41
will keep changing again and again so don't focus on a narrow set of skills
1:05:47
try to acquire a broad set of skills and the mental flexibility to keep learning
1:05:54
as you said it it could threaten the humanities but also the sciences just last year the Nobel Prize in Physics and
1:06:02
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry went for the development of AI maybe in 10 years
1:06:08
all the Nobel prizes will just go to AI nobel Prize in physics chemistry
1:06:14
economics literature all of them will be given to AIs that write books or that
1:06:20
made new discoveries in science we don't know so as a young person if you focus
1:06:28
on a narrow set of skills you're making a very huge bet like if you think okay I
1:06:34
will learn to code computers but maybe in 10 years AI codes computers much
1:06:39
better than any human can so you don't need coders in general humans have three
1:06:46
types of skills we have intellectual skills like what you use in engineering
1:06:53
or science we have social skills emotional skills how to relate and
1:06:58
interact with other humans and we have motor skills bodily skills now the
1:07:05
easiest tasks to automate by AI are
1:07:10
those that demand only intellectual skills like if you think again about medicine
1:07:17
if you have a doctor that only engages in intellectual skills like uh uh the
1:07:24
doctor gets a lot of information about your medical condition analyzes it um uh
1:07:31
discovers what is your sickness and writes you a prescription here take a prescription this is only intellectual
1:07:39
skill this is the easiest thing for an AI to take over
1:07:44
because no matter how smart the doctor is he's always limited or she's always
1:07:50
limited and AI can read a lot more medical books than any doctor can
1:07:57
process information much faster than any doctor so the easiest jobs to automate
1:08:03
are jobs like this now think about the job let's say of a nurse that needs
1:08:09
intellectual skills to some extent but also needs social skills like let's say
1:08:15
there is a a child that was hurt and you need to change a bandage and the child
1:08:20
is screaming and crying in order to take care of the child you need some social
1:08:26
emotional skills how to how to relate how to talk with the child and of course
1:08:32
you need motor skills how to replace the bandage it's very delicate you don't want to to to harm the child to to cause
1:08:40
more pain replacing this nurse this human nurse
1:08:46
with an AI robot will be not impossible but much much more difficult than
1:08:53
replacing the doctor because you need intellectual social and motor skills at
1:08:59
the same time so the advice for young people is try to
1:09:05
develop all three kinds of skills simultaneously you invest some of your time in reading
1:09:13
books and learning biology and history and developing your intellect but you must also develop your social skills and
1:09:20
motor skills and most importantly to develop a flexible mind so that as the job market
1:09:29
continues to change you are able to keep learning and changing throughout your
1:09:35
life yes
1:10:20
exactly i mean some of it some of it is in is outside us in society and some of
1:10:27
it is outside the brain in our body i think there is too much emphasis on the
1:10:33
brain in how we try to understand human beings but we we we are we have an
1:10:38
entire body not just a brain and actually if you look at the evolution of
1:10:44
animals and humans uh there is a good chance that the real center of control
1:10:50
of humans even today is not the brain but actually further down in the stomach
1:10:56
like our ancient ancestors hundreds of millions of years ago were
1:11:02
worms going you know these little worms which are basically just a tube with two
1:11:09
openings one opening to take food in and one opening to expel waste from the body
1:11:15
out that was the animal a tube now this
1:11:20
ancient worms they did not have a brain they had a nervous system but the center
1:11:26
of the nervous system was simply in the center of the tube in the stomach where the food was digested
1:11:34
over millions of years more and more nerves evolved around the mouth the the
1:11:41
entry of the tube where you take food why because the worm needed to check
1:11:48
what food is good what food is dangerous what other dangers might be out there so
1:11:53
it developed taste to taste the food and smell to smell the food and eyes to see
1:11:59
the food and it needed a lot of nerves neurons to control all these senses so
1:12:06
the brain developed near the mouth we humans today we still have the same
1:12:13
basic structure we are still basically a worm think about us we are a long tube
1:12:20
starting here and going twisting until the other side of course we have hands
1:12:25
and feet but these are just uh additions to the basic structure of a human which
1:12:32
is still a worm and our brains are still
1:12:37
near our mouths but maybe the real center of control is where it was always
1:12:45
in ancient times in the stomach like if you look at the human nervous system you
1:12:51
see that there are most of the neurons are here in the brain but there are also
1:12:56
millions of neurons in the spinal cord and just the number of neurons doesn't
1:13:03
tell you where the central of control is you know if you look at a country so you
1:13:09
have millions of provincial officials spread over the country but the actual
1:13:16
decisions are made by a few leaders in the capital city so maybe the brain is
1:13:24
like these millions of petty officials taking their orders from the big leaders
1:13:30
which are still in the area of the stomach we don't understand how the brain
1:13:37
functions so you know I I wouldn't concentrate too much just on the brain i
1:13:44
think to understand the human you need to understand the whole body okay
1:14:34
so you know in the past information was scarce like maybe you live in some small
1:14:39
town and there is just one library in the town with just a few books and that's it so the main role of schools
1:14:48
was to provide children with information now information is overabundant we are
1:14:54
flooded by far too much information schools don't need to focus on providing
1:15:01
kids with more information what children really need is the ability to tell the
1:15:07
difference between reliable and unreliable information most information in the world is not the
1:15:15
truth most information is fictions and fantasies and lies and so forth why
1:15:24
because there are three reasons why the truth is quite a rare kind of information
1:15:30
first the truth tends to be costly because it takes a lot of time and
1:15:36
effort and money to do research and gather evidence and analyze it so the
1:15:42
truth is costly whereas fiction is very cheap you don't need any research in
1:15:47
order to write fiction you just write anything you want the truth is often complicated because reality is
1:15:54
complicated whereas fiction can be made very very simple and the truth is
1:15:59
sometimes painful unpleasant there are things we don't want to know about ourselves or
1:16:05
about the world they make us feel uncomfortable but they are the truth fiction can be made as pleasant and as
1:16:12
flattering as you would like it to be so in this competition between costly
1:16:19
complicated painful truth and cheap simple attractive fiction fiction tends
1:16:27
to win and the world is flooded by fiction and fantasy and the truth is
1:16:32
very rare so I think the maybe one of the most important jobs of schools is to
1:16:40
teach kids how do you tell the difference between reliable and
1:16:45
unreliable information like this is what I teach students in history classes in
1:16:51
history classes in university you don't teach students to memorize
1:16:57
names and dates of kings and battles from the past they don't need it what
1:17:02
they really need is how do I know which information to trust so let's say I
1:17:09
found a document that says that something happened 500 years ago how do
1:17:15
I know if I can trust this document so there are many many methods you can for
1:17:21
instance test the material of the document the paper we have scientific
1:17:27
methods like carbon 14 test to know whether this paper was really produced
1:17:34
500 years ago or just a 100 years ago and if we see it was produced a 100
1:17:39
years ago it means the document cannot be from 500 years ago like this there
1:17:45
are many methods to know the difference and I think schools should focus to a
1:17:52
large extent on on this task the other main tasks of schools is again to help
1:17:59
children develop flexible minds so that they will be able to keep
1:18:05
learning and changing throughout their lives the assumption of schools in the
1:18:11
past was that now the children are learning things in the future they will
1:18:17
work they will not learn but new schools should assume that people will continue
1:18:23
to learn throughout their lives that the world will change very rapidly and dramatically in the coming years so we
1:18:31
need to find new ways how to build very flexible minds that can keep learning
1:18:38
and changing even when the person becomes 40 or 50 or 60
1:18:46
for

1:20:04
and the big question is what can humans content providers ers still bring to to
1:20:09
the table we cannot compete with AI on quantity that's for sure we cannot
1:20:15
compete also in the ability to to consume and analyze enormous amounts of
1:20:21
data so for the present moment what we can bring to the table is really only
1:20:27
our humanity our ability to feel things our life experiences this is something
1:20:33
that AI doesn't have and because as we discussed earlier it still has no
1:20:38
consciousness no feelings so everything it knows about feelings comes from what
1:20:44
we tell it we are still the only ones that can make new discoveries about that
1:20:52
if you think about other things in the universe about diseases about atoms
1:20:57
about physics and chemistry their AI will very soon be much much better than
1:21:03
us it will be very difficult for humans to still make important e discoveries in
1:21:12
physics or chemistry let's say in 20 years because AI will just be so much
1:21:18
better but when it comes to the human experience to feelings to emotions to relationships
1:21:26
here we still have an advantage as long as AIs don't have any feelings any
1:21:33
consciousness of itself self
1:21:54
yeah
1:22:12
further I agree that this this specific product it's no longer viable for human
1:22:18
beings to briefly summarize a book in 30 minutes or in three minutes ai is now so
1:22:26
much better i mean you when I try to summarize a book I can offer basically one summary but with an AI you can give
1:22:34
it exact instructions like I want you to summarize Nexus in exactly six and a
1:22:40
half minutes and do it on in in in a language which is applicable for
1:22:46
somebody who is 14 years old you can be so specific and the AI will give you
1:22:53
this summary and then you tell it okay now do it 12 minutes for somebody who is
1:22:59
70 it will do it 12 minutes for somebody who is 70 um so here I don't think that
1:23:05
humans can compete again this is going back to uh uh the the the thing that
1:23:11
something that involves only intellectual abilities we have no chance of competing with AI
1:23:19
if the task is simply to take data to take words and process them and the
1:23:27
product is more words like you take a book you analyze it and then you produce
1:23:33
a five minute summary we have no chance of competing with AI on that
1:23:48
so again if taking again this example of a book you can tell readers or audience
1:23:55
uh what you felt when reading the book and this is something AI cannot compete
1:24:01
with you right now because it has no feelings so we again and again come back to the
1:24:07
same conclusion that the key distinction is between intelligence and
1:24:13
consciousness and in intelligence we cannot compete with AI it is going to be
1:24:19
far more intelligent than us but in consciousness at least for now we have
1:24:24
the advantage because AI has no consciousness
1:24:47
um I think that together the four books give you a very very big picture of
1:24:54
humanity of our history you know from the stone age to the AI revolution and
1:24:59
they the books are not separate but they reinforce one another if you understand
1:25:05
our history it makes it much easier to understand what is happening right now
1:25:12
and what might happen in the future and I don't see history as just the study of the past i understand history as the
1:25:19
study of change if we understand how things changed in the past it gives us
1:25:26
insight into how things are changing right now because you understand the
1:25:31
mechanism of change
